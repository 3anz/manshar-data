That was an obligation to celebrate .. to act happy .. to take photos where you are forced to smile in, and even to participate in games you don’t want to play, just because someone came here asked you to do so, and you have no chance to say no, because at that time you’ll be the weird one who doesn’t welcome joy, and prefer the sad corner, where they put those who are rejected by the public, but who are the public?!</p><p class=\"guid-tagged\" title=\"bb7fbd47-b909-4715-b185-0cbcbe2aa806\">\r\n\r\n</p><p class=\"guid-tagged\" title=\"f410c284-80cc-4773-871a-8fff4232aef5\" style=\"direction: ltr;\">In my dictionary, the public are the friends .. the ones who I love to be around .. who I love to act silly with .. whose presence is just sufficient to me, who accept me as who I am, which is the same I do for them.

Why should I’ve to appear like the old people showing up in weddings, sitting on tables, faking a smile, when the photographer comes to take a picture of them, spotting his annoying light directly into their faces?! That’s not my nature anyway, then why they’ve succeeded to portray me awfully like that?</p><p class=\"guid-tagged\" title=\"ac2b9a45-d8b6-48d9-85fd-c90276cfddb4\">\r\n\r\n</p><p class=\"guid-tagged\" title=\"3b356a94-bd43-4119-9b5a-6d5b43426ce0\" style=\"direction: ltr;\">I admit I wasn’t courageous enough to say no .. no to the fake picture .. no to the stupid games ..
