# [Manshar](https://github.com/manshar)'s data
Once upon time, there was a web app called [manshar.com](https://manshar.com), it was a publishing platform for Arabic bloggers.
For some reasons the maintainer behind it doesn't give a damn about it anymore, I thought it's gone forever.

Some days ago, I noticed that the APIs are still active behind unsecure connection (seems like the SSL certificates are expired or whatever).
I scrapped the APIs for the articles and downloaded all of the published articles in `JSON`format.

# Can I use this?
I don't know, I am just trying to save the data

# Why is the body in such format?
The writing used a tool called [carbon](https://github.com/carbon-tools/carbon), refer to it to know why the body is like this.
